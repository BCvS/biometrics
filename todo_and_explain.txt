- deepface lib is extremely inefficient, i explain why
- VGG-face2 is not a model, i explain
- I will make one more comparisonchart of front-front
- I will make 2 large matrices for vgg-face2, one with brightness and one with noise

plz do:
- plz describe models compared (lit research)
- check what others have done (lit research, make sure to check 2012 paper)
- plz describe research setup, including mtcnn: dataset[1..30]->handpick_angles->apply_variables->mtcnn->image_verification_with_model
	- explain mtcnn sometimes does not recognize face, find out and explain implications
	- explain inneficiency of deepface in this situation
	- explain what variable values mean for every variable
- Evaluate results
- Explain limitations: only 30 faces, hand-picked angles (no hard-defined angles in used db)
- Possible future research: 
		- use variables to create accurate representation of worst-case scenario passport photo or test photo
		- larger dataset, 
		- more accurate dataset with concrete angles, 
		- add up-down angles, 
		- more types of variables, 
		- smaller variable transition steps,
		- more in-depth analysis of one specific model (e.g. VGG-Face2), 
		- direct comparison with other image recognition methodss
